Let me analyze the codebase and suggest improvements.

Flow of Execution:

inference_llama3.py: Loads a Llama 3 model and performs text generation
training_llama3.py: Fine-tunes a Llama 3 model using LoRA
visualize_training.py: Visualizes training metrics from logs
Dependencies:

Primary: torch, unsloth, transformers, trl, datasets, accelerate, bitsandbytes
Visualization: matplotlib
CUDA-enabled GPU (highly recommended)
Python 3.8+ (recommended for all dependencies)
Installation:

Here are the suggested improvements:

Potential Problems & Prerequisites:

GPU Memory Management:

Monitor GPU memory usage
Implement cleanup routines
Consider gradient checkpointing
Data Quality:

Validate dataset format
Ensure proper tokenization
Handle edge cases in sequences
Error Handling:

Graceful failure handling
Logging for debugging
Resource cleanup
Performance:

Optimize batch sizes
Use proper data loading
Monitor training metrics
Suggestions:

Add configuration validation
Implement proper logging
Add memory monitoring
Create helper utilities
Add data validation
Implement checkpointing
Add training resumption
Monitor system resources
Add progress bars
Create output validation
Each script should be enhanced with these improvements for better reliability and maintainability. Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect.
